# Insurance_cost_prediction
Built a regression model to predict medical insurance costs
# 🏥 Insurance Cost Prediction Web App

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts medical insurance costs based on customer demographics and health-related factors using machine learning. The model is deployed as an interactive web application.


## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Number of Children
- Smoking Status
- Region


## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: **Random Forest Regressor**
- Handles non-linear relationships
- More accurate than basic linear models
